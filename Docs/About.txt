Hi,

Created this Lightweight version of the taskbar area application WeekNumber.

The only features this "Lite" version of WeekNumber has is to display the current week number in the Windows System Tray Area via its icon.
There are no settings or such for this version; cannot change icon color, auto-update or anything else fancy that exists in the original WeekNumber app.

Cheers,
  Joakim
