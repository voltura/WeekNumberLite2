Hi,

Created this Lightweight version of the taskbar area application WeekNumber since Windows Defender reported WeekNumber as a trojan (FALSE!) 
and some people might still want the app without Microsoft blocking the app and having to unblock it or simply do not know how and loose the app feature.

The only features this "Lite" version of WeekNumber has is to display the current week number in the Windows System Tray Area via its icon.
There are no settings or such for this version; cannot change icon color, auto-update or anything else fancy that exists in the original WeekNumber app.

Cheers,
  Joakim
